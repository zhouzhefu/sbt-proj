;; Sublime is about to run the following commands:
;;
;;    cd "/Users/winniewang/source/sublime2-workspace/sbt-proj"
;;    sbt "ensime generate"
;;
;; In a moment a build panel will pop up and progressively display the output of SBT.
;; If everything goes well, this file will be filled in with an Ensime configuration filled in from your SBT project.
;; (In case if this buffer doesn't get updated after SBT finishes, click File > Revert File to forcibly reload the file from disk).
;; If something doesn't work, try running the commands provided above from your terminal.
;; (If you can't figure it out, feel free to contact us at dev@sublimescala.org).
